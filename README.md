This is a web application for voice-to-text user experiments. I implemented this application for the pilot study, which was part of my Master Thesis. 
First, users answer some questions, and next, they speak out the input which is provided by the experimenter.

### Use case scenario
You aim to implement a system which user can control via vocal commands. One potential problem in using speech recognition systems is transcription (speech-to-text) error (for instance, due to the user accent). You can run this vocal-experiment application to identify the common transcription errors while using your custom vocal commands.  


### Usage
Clone the project in the web folder. Then, you access it with: http://localhost/vocalExperiment/load.php

**Note:**  the form for sending the data to the server is in the body.php

Currently **Compatible with Chrome**
